# PYCULATOR
 
A simple calculator made by me, entirely in python, without any lib.
This is my first project on github so don't be surprised if you see something bad.


HOW TO USE:
 
to use it, just run the code in the code editor/terminal, and a menu will appear showing the mathematical operations that can be used and the initial letters, which can be used next.
under the menu an input will appear asking: which operation do you want to use? and the answer that you must use has to be one of the initials of the operations (a,s,m,d,p) if n use none of these, the result of the account will not appear. after choosing the operation, another input will appear this time wanting you to put a number, if you don't put a number the code will give an error, so put a number of your choice but this will be the number on the left of the account, after choosing, it will another input appears wanting you to put one more number, but this time it's the one on the right, for example:

[what's the first number?] 3

[what's the second?] 6

account: 6 + 3

result: 9
________________________________
After that, the result of the account will appear and that's it, the account is over.
but another entry will appear asking if you are going to make another account, if you want to make another one, type "y" if not, type "n".
if you press y it will start making the inputs to make another account, when it finishes it will ask for repetition again, and it will do this until the user doesn't want it anymore.

IMPORTANT:
maybe when doing hard math with power and multiplication, involving too high numbers, the result takes a long time to appear, so don't think the calculator has stopped.

HOW TO INSTALL:
use this command in terminal:

git clone https://github.com/IagoManoel/pyculator.git

Or install the file ZIP.
